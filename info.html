    <h1>A deeper look into Bebo</h1>

    <p>AOL was trying hard to “buy and merge its way into relevancy” and saw Bebo as an opportunity 
        to enter the hot social networking space and turn its business around. 
        At the time, AOL was laying off thousands of employees as it tried to refocus. 
        Bebo was meant to be “the cornerstone” of AOL’s online strategy.
         Despite the fact that it was a second-tier social network falling far 
         behind Facebook and Myspace, Bebo still had a respectable 40 million total 
         users and 22 million uniquely monthly visitors as well as strong security features and a 
         functional developer platform for third-party applications.
