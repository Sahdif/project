    <h1>BEBO - The Failing Success</h1>
    <h2>What is Bebo?</h2>
    <p>
        When talking about social media apps and websites, we usally think of 
        YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. However, Bebo was another social media platform
        that was competing these giants and the time it was made in 2005. Founded by couple
        Michael Birch and Xochi Birch who aimed to compete with the social media
        giants.
    </p>
    <h2>What's Special About It?</h2>
    <p>
        At the time, there was another company named AOL looking to enter the 
        social media race and eyed Bebo in an attempt to do it. They offered
        the couple an <strong>amazing $850M</strong> to buy out the company in which 
        the offer was accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Altough it sounded like everything was ready for AOL to make a big scene
        in the social media world, Bebo was just not able to compete with the other platforms
        and eventually flopped and plummeted in value. Reports state that AOL sold it to digital media 
        investors Criterion Capital Partners in 2010 for a reported $10 million.
    </p>
    <p>
        What's amazing is that in 2013, Bebo was bought by none other than the 
        founders themselves for a <strong>shocking $1M</strong>. They expressed
        their interest in attempting to turn Bebo into a product that people will use
        like how they invisioned all the way back in 2005
